          <h3>For every stray dog</h3>
          <p>
            Many stray dogs are gentle and still trust people despite being left behind. 
            The Pawradise Project shares their stories to help readers understand how to care, protect, 
            and show kindness to dogs on the streets.

          <h3>For every stray cat</h3>
          <p>
            Stray cats live quietly and are easily ignored. Through simple guides and stories, 
            The Pawradise Project helps people learn how to feed and help cats safely and responsibly.

          <strong>Why Pawradise Started</strong>
          <p>
            Pawradise started as a simple idea, to give stray dogs and cats a voice, 
            and to help people see them not as a problem in the community, but as lives that matter.

          <strong>What We Stand For</strong>
          <p>
            This project supports animal care, rescue, and welfare, guided by compassion and 
            aligned with the Republic Act No. 8485 of the Philippines, also known as the Animal Welfare Act of 1998.

          <strong>Where We Are Now</strong>

            The Pawradise Project just started as blog inspired 
            by stray dogs and cats, aimed at awareness, compassion, and future action.
